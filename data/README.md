## The folder `data`

### Why is this folder empty?

We use the folder **`data`** to store the artefacts that are generated during the analysis, so this folder should appear empty on GitHub. Large files cannot be pushed to GitHub as done with code but we keep this folder so that upon i) `git clone` of this repo and ii) acquiring the input files provided with the publication you will be able to reuse the Jupyter Notebooks without the need to change filepaths in the code.
